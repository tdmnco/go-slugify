## About

This repository contains simplified functions for slugifying strings in Go. Note that emojis are not supported, the functionality kept in this module is meant to be overly simplified.

## Getting Help

We believe in an open and welcoming community for all. Please post your questions in the [Issues](https://github.com/tdmnco/go-slugify/issues) section here at GitHub or contact Kasper Tidemann directly at [kt@tdmn.co](kt@tdmn.co).

Note that if your question has general relevance, it might be worth sharing with others.
